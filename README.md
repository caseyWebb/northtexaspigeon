# NorthTexasPigeon.com

This is a rewrite (WIP) of NorthTexasPigeon.com.

It aims to provide a better UX, more capable admin panel,
and a better JSON API.

It also aims to make better use of promises, and keep the
controllers from getting out of hand.

Last but not least, this version of the NTPigeon will see
a migration to ElasticSearch from MongoDB.

All endpoints will respond to both JSON and HTML requests.
This is going to allow some cool stuff like keeping the site
search-engine friendly, but once loaded, we can just fetch
JSON data and stick it in a template.
