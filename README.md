# NorthTexasPigeon.com

This is a rewrite (WIP) of NorthTexasPigeon.com.

It aims to provide a better UX, more capable admin panel,
and .

Endpoints will be able to respond with either the entire page,
or rendered HTML partials that can be swapped out on the client.
This is going to allow some cool stuff like keeping the site
search-engine friendly, but once loaded, we can just fetch
a partial and stick it in the DOM.

_Contribution is open to UNT students looking to build their GitHub
profile. If you want to contribute, but don't know where to start,
